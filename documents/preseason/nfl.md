We are well into training camps, and the preseason is heating up. No better time to update the Power Rankings than now.

The top remains pretty constant from my post-draft pecking order, although there were changes through the middle and lower tiers, some of which I foreshadowed in my Divisional Power Rankings from last month.

Micah Parsons' trade request has shaken things up in Dallas. The Colts' QB battle has changed their standing. The rebuild in Chicago has hit some rough patches, even with optimism still relatively high. And certain rookies are making positive impressions in camps, altering my outlook of their teams' situations.

Let's take all these camp developments, roll 'em all up and see what the new order looks like as we sit roughly one month from the start of the regular season.

NOTE: Up/down arrows below reflect team movement from April's Power Rankings, which were published after the 2025 NFL Draft.

1
Philadelphia Eagles
Philadelphia Eagles
There’s a current 20-year streak of no repeat champions in the NFC East. That streak started right about when I took over the NFC East beat for Pro Football Weekly a lifetime ago, and every season, like clockwork, there would be a new champ. This year’s Eagles are as well-prepared to handle the divisional rigors as almost any reigning East champ during the streak, even with some offseason personnel losses and the Commanders charging hard. With Jalen Hurts leading a balanced, mature and dangerous offense and (at worst) a top-10 defense in place, the Eagles profile as strong contenders once again. I won’t go so far as to guarantee the streak comes to an end this season, but I also have no reason to doubt this team right now.

Baltimore Ravens
Baltimore Ravens
The Ravens are seeking their third straight division title and, tough as the AFC North might be, they should be considered the favorites. With perennial MVP candidate Lamar Jackson in his prime and Derrick Henry still seemingly close to his peak, the Ravens will be a nightmare matchup for most teams. They’ve still been capable of some shocking losses the past few seasons, both in the regular season and playoffs, so there’s a consistency issue Baltimore must address. The defense took a step backward early last season, but first-year coordinator Zach Orr made some savvy tweaks to flip the script down the stretch. That unit shouldn’t be considered a worry in 2025, with the refreshed secondary being a good reason for optimism. Strangely, special teams remain a question mark in Baltimore after years of excellence there. The kicking and return games are camp issues that must be worked out.

Rank
3
Kansas City Chiefs
Kansas City Chiefs
The Chiefs are underrated defensively. That unit helped keep the team in every game last season, at least until the Super Bowl, and most of the group returns intact. But the offense has been on a two-year downturn, and we don’t know how much longer Travis Kelce will play beyond this season. There’s also the possibility that the Chiefs start a rookie left tackle, something that didn’t work out well a year ago. If Josh Simmons wins the job, he likely will be lined up next to Kingsley Suamataia, who only lasted a few games at that LT spot before being moved to left guard this year. How that duo performs protecting Patrick Mahomes' blind side could determine if the Chiefs can make strides offensively.

Rank
4
Buffalo Bills
Buffalo Bills
Early camp has been littered with some pesky injuries, especially at receiver and in the secondary, with first-round CB Maxwell Hairston currently sidelined. The Bills probably can survive some of the WR injuries if Keon Coleman can stay healthy and make a big jump in Year 2, but that’s hardly a guarantee. Likewise, fellow second-year pro Cole Bishop could help improve the secondary with a level-up season. Hairston’s knee sprain doesn’t appear too concerning, but it could lead to Tre’Davious White taking a starting gig early on. The Bills clearly are one of the best teams in football, led by reigning MVP Josh Allen, and winning the division again should be the obvious goal, but there are enough early worries to keep them in this spot. This team obviously has bigger aspirations, but it remains third in the AFC for now.

Rank
5
Detroit Lions
Detroit Lions
There are some signs that it could be a bumpier road this season for the Lions, who are replacing both coordinators, facing a wicked schedule and playing in a tightly packed NFC North. On top of that, the retirement of Frank Ragnow and season-ending ACL injury for Levi Onwuzurike have carried over the unfortunate attrition from last season. The Lions still have several players working their way back from previous ailments, too. Thankfully, Aidan Hutchinson doesn’t appear to be one of them, as he’s apparently been dominating camp practices. First-round DT Tyleik Williams and second-round IOL Tate Ratledge have also impressed in the absence of Onwuzurike and Ragnow. And keep an eye on third-round WR Isaac TeSlaa, who could get a lot of work this preseason and might even crack the rotation early in the regular season. I’m not selling on this team just yet.

Rank
6
Washington Commanders
Washington Commanders
The Terry McLaurin trade request has taken some of the sheen off an otherwise-buzzy offseason, but we’ve also seen big-name standoffs end in new deals this offseason, so the panic meter remains pretty low for me. The offense should be great again. I could see the Commanders making incremental improvements from last season on defense, but it’s hard to argue that they’re tangibly better on that side of the ball. I’d even argue they’re a tad bit worse, personnel-wise, until proven otherwise. Washington made a big statement last season, and it’s capable of just as much or more this time around, but it won’t come easy. There are some potholes dotting the road right now.

Rank
7
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Tampa Bay’s offense has a chance to be among the best groups in the NFL. It was arguably a top-five attack last season, and I truly think it could be even better this season, assuming the Tristan Wirfs injury doesn't linger too long. Rookie WR Emeka Egbuka apparently looks good early. Rachaad White is reportedly slimmed down. Wirfs and Chris Godwin might be tough calls for Week 1, but the big-picture operation looks strong. Defensively, I think the Buccaneers be better, especially in the secondary. If that unit can play above where it did down the stretch last season, this will be a team capable of making a Super Bowl run. Sure, Jayden Daniels gave them trouble in the playoff loss, and the Bucs forced zero turnovers in the final four games, but the defense was already headed in the right direction before adding some offseason help and getting healthier.

Green Bay Packers
Green Bay Packers
Left tackle seems to be up in the air, with Jordan Morgan attempting to unseat Rasheed Walker. The early returns on the wide receiver room appear to be good, with first-rounder Matthew Golden making a strong first impression. Dropped passes were a huge problem for the Packers a year ago, and Jordan Love is entering a critical season where he needs the operation around him to be as clean as possible. If those two areas are improved, it’s easy to see the Packers being a tough out. Defensively, I am less sure about them. The front seven will be decent -- at the very worst -- but there are some holes to patch in the secondary. That area worries me a little bit. 

Rank

Los Angeles Rams
Los Angeles Rams
Matthew Stafford is currently dealing with back pain, and there have been various other minor camp injuries, too. If the Rams are going to be more than just a dangerous team in the postseason, they need to avoid another slow start, having opened the last two seasons at 1-4 and 3-6. Keeping Stafford healthy obviously is a major component of that effort. Otherwise, why bring in Davante Adams for the money they did? Yes, Los Angeles pushed Philadelphia to the brink in last season's playoffs, but this was a team that struggled to hold firm down the stretch, and there’s no guarantee it'll be better in the secondary this season. The Rams are the nominal favorites in the NFC West, and I’ve learned never to doubt Sean McVay, but L.A. slides just outside of the top quartile for now.

Rank
10
Minnesota Vikings
Minnesota Vikings
I’ve seen people drop the Vikings much farther than this in their preseason rankings, and frankly, it’s surprising to me. I feel a little sheepish putting them this low. If you’re asking me if they’re strong candidates for a win regression following a 14-3 season, I’ll say yes. But I’ll also counter that this Vikings team doesn’t have many warts. The depth at a few spots worries me, but we all know what the biggest coefficient is destined to be: the play of J.J. McCarthy. Not everyone is convinced he’ll elevate the team. I am willing to give him a good chance to be special one day. He’s entering a terrific situation, well-protected, well-armed and with a defense behind him that can cover quite a few tracks.

Rank
11
Denver Broncos
Denver Broncos
The Broncos are a fascinating team that could be on the verge of breaking through. Bo Nix deftly answered a lot of challenges last season. The defense could be the best unit in the league; at worst, it’s a top-five group. Denver added some skill-position talent to the till. I don’t see many glaring personnel voids. What the 2024 Broncos needed to do better was finish off close games and win more often against top-tier talent. They were 1-6 in one-score games, and after the Week 3 win at Tampa, there were really no more signature victories against good teams. (Beating a Chiefs team resting its starters in Week 18 doesn’t count.) The 2025 schedule is tougher, and I still wonder how much the offense really added to the backfield, but Denver is pointed in the right direction. If the Broncos can survive the AFC West gauntlet, the playoffs are within reach again.

Rank
12
Cincinnati Bengals
Cincinnati Bengals
I’m not taking a side in the negotiations, but I am here to analyze impact. And just because Trey Hendrickson is in town doesn’t mean anything has really changed with his status. He’s not practicing, just like Ja’Marr Chase wasn’t practicing last summer until two weeks before the Week 1 loss to the Patriots. The Bengals started 0-3, and Chase didn’t play that well in the first two games. Cincinnati's defense certainly takes a lot of blame for last year’s poor start -- and disappointing season -- and that was with Hendrickson on the field dominating. Unless there’s a fairly quick resolution, both sides could be cutting this thing a bit close. Four of Cincy's first six games are on the road, and the middle part of the schedule looks grueling.

Rank
13
Los Angeles Chargers
Los Angeles Chargers
In a best-case scenario, the Chargers won’t have to lean on Trey Lance or any other quarterback not named Justin Herbert this season. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t good to see Lance perform well in the Hall of Fame Game, making a stronger push for the backup job. The Chargers had to deal for Taylor Heinicke last August and were fortunate Herbert stayed healthy last season after some early ankle issues. Realistically, in the big picture, the Chargers will go as far as Herbert can carry them, and he could receive a decent amount of help from rookies Omarion Hampton, Tre Harris and KeAndre Lambert-Smith. The reshuffled offensive line theoretically should be better, too. Whether the Chargers’ defense can play at the same level it did in 2024 is a fair question. Receiving a boost from the offense can help the entire operation.

Rank
14
Houston Texans
Houston Texans
This remains a tricky team for me. On the one hand, the Texans clearly have the best quarterback right now in a weaker division, and the secondary could be a massive strength. On the other hand, Joe Mixon’s availability is murky, the offensive line has a lot to prove, and I am not sure Houston has the weapons after Nico Collins. There’s a lot to like about C.J. Stroud and his chances to move forward after a sideways sophomore campaign. I just worry that the offense in general is going to be a work in progress early on. Can DeMeco Ryans’ defense hold serve for the time being? I think so. I just wonder if there’s anything close to a title contender here.

Rank
15
San Francisco 49ers
San Francisco 49ers
The 49ers’ defense could receive a lot of help from rookies and new veteran faces. There are some battles to figure out at safety, linebacker and the pass-rush spots outside of Nick Bosa, but I expect substantial improvement from this D. Bosa is back and looks better overall, and Robert Saleh is running the show like old times. It might take some time getting this unit back into peak shape, but the potential is there over the course of the season. Offensively, the Niners need more availability from Christian McCaffrey, and the receiver room has to sort itself out. Ricky Pearsall is an important player for them this season. If Brock Purdy and CMC stay relatively healthy this season, I’ll be surprised if San Francisco is not back among the contending ranks.

Pittsburgh Steelers
Pittsburgh Steelers
The offense seems to be working through things as it gets Aaron Rodgers up to speed and starts figuring out all the roles: who’ll be the second receiver, how the RB rotation will shake out and which personnel packages will be featured most. Things have settled down since Rodgers’ first-play INT to open camp, but the anxiety remains over just how prolific this unit will end up being. Defensively, there’s strong hope this could be a top-10 unit, but memories of Pittsburgh's late-season collapse on that side of the ball remain fresh. I like that the schedule seems to ramp up in difficulty as the season goes along. Early bye weeks are never players’ favorites, and the Steelers are off in Week 5, but they will have a chance to settle into the early part of the regular season before things truly heat up down the stretch.

Chicago Bears
Chicago Bears
There has been some early panic over the play of Caleb Williams following the team’s Family Fest practice at Soldier Field on Sunday. Williams finished strong with a TD pass to cap the scoring, but that was preceded by multiple play-clock violations, several errant throws and a safety by the defense on a run play inside the 1-yard line. In short, it was ugly. Ben Johnson has not made excuses for the Bears’ occasional offensive struggles in camp, and they could enter the season with a rookie left tackle, so it’s fair to say there’s some anxiety. But the offense hasn’t been all bad in camp, and we knew it was going to take some time for Williams and Johnson (and everyone else) to mesh here. As long as Chicago’s defense can avoid melting down the way it did in the second half of last season, the Bears figure to be more competitive and sturdy this time around.

Rank

Arizona Cardinals
Arizona Cardinals
Don’t sleep on the Cardinals. Sure, I’ve said similar things, sotto voce, for the past year and a half or so, but I earnestly believe there’s something interesting brewing here. I thought Kyler Murray played pretty well last season, and a breakout year from Marvin Harrison Jr. could level this offense up a notch. Defensively, there’s a good mix-and-match thing happening at multiple positions, including safety and outside linebacker, giving Arizona plenty of options. Even with Walter Nolen sidelined, the front looks far more capable of collapsing pockets this season. I believe the Cards are contenders out West if the defense can make tangible improvements, and that might depend on how much 2024 first-rounder Darius Robinson and rookies Nolen, Will Johnson and Jordan Burch can contribute. 

Rank
19
Seattle Seahawks
Seattle Seahawks
I am curious to see what the offense turns into with so many new parts. Sam Darnold is, of course, the biggest X-factor. Cooper Kupp is the top new receiver. Zach Charbonnet appears to be making a strong case to share carries with Kenneth Walker III. There are changes on the offensive line. Rookie playmakers Elijah Arroyo and Tory Horton have turned heads early in camp. The Seahawks don’t need to be world-beaters on offense, but they must be more consistent. They scored 20 or fewer points seven times last season and somehow won three of those games. Mike Macdonald’s defense might not reach the tier his Baltimore units did, but there’s enough talent on that side of the ball to be more effective against the elite offenses on the schedule. This is a team with a wider range of outcomes, I suspect, but I lean toward Seattle being competitive.

Dallas Cowboys
Dallas Cowboys
The Micah Parsons news has dominated the headlines since the start of camp, and for good reason. Even if we brush off Parsons’ trade request as the necessary and uncomfortable part of contract negotiations, the Cowboys have still been without one of their most indispensable players all of camp so far. You can’t count on a consistent pass rush without him, even if second-rounder Donovan Ezeiruaku continues impressing. Then on offense, there’s the question of how much preseason time Dak Prescott will receive coming off hamstring surgery. He needs the time to mesh with Brian Schottenheimer and new WR George Pickens, but the Cowboys also can’t risk their QB getting hurt. There have been some tense moments early in camp, but this team’s story has not yet been written.

21
Atlanta Falcons
Atlanta Falcons
Right now, Darnell Mooney is a question mark for Week 1, and QB Michael Penix Jr. has had some ups and downs in camp. The offense figures to lean on the run game until Penix can get his feet underneath him. Reports have suggested that Penix’s accuracy is something to monitor, which shouldn’t be shocking after he hit on 58 percent of his passes in three rookie starts. The Falcons will have to live with some of that, and they have the run game to support things in the short term. Do they have the defense to help manage games? Interestingly, one of the early camp stars has been James Pearce Jr., the second of two pass rushers Atlanta drafted. Jalon Walker has been sidelined with a hamstring injury, but Pearce -- a controversial pick who cost the Falcons next year’s first-rounder -- has looked like an instant contributor.

New England Patriots
New England Patriots
The early offensive returns have been a bit disappointing, with the Patriots seemingly focused on the quick passing game and getting the ball out of Drake Maye’s hands quickly. It seems that will be a focus this season, at least early on, with two expected rookie OL starters in Will Campbell and Jared Wilson manning the left side of the line. There also have been mixed results from the wide receivers, limiting the offense’s overall appeal. But there’s something brewing on defense if the Patriots can get Christian Gonzalez and Carlton Davis back on the field. I think the improved pass rush will help stabilize this unit early on. There absolutely is an opening for second place in the AFC East, and the Patriots have the pathway to take it this season, even after back-to-back 4-13 campaigns.

Jacksonville Jaguars
Jacksonville Jaguars
If I had to guess, based on the early tea leaves, we’ll see about a 60-40 mix for Travis Hunter on offense and defense, and it wouldn’t stun me if that 60 number goes up as the season progresses. Hunter is already must-see TV and should be a fun dance partner alongside Brian Thomas Jr. in an offense that’s being broken down and, hopefully, built back up again. There’s still time for Trevor Lawrence to turn this thing around, and he has some horses and a scheme that should help. Lawrence and Thomas still need to fine tune their connection; Thomas did much of his damage last season with Mac Jones at QB. But if the Jaguars’ pass protection and pass rush improve, it could be a solid rebound season in Liam Coen’s head-coaching debut.

Las Vegas Raiders
Las Vegas Raiders
There’s real optimism that Pete Carroll and a far-better-looking offensive picture can make the Raiders plucky contenders this season. Surviving the AFC West is no joke, and Las Vegas is looking up at the field currently. Improving on last year’s 0-6 division mark is a great place to start. Making major strides defensively would be another major objective. It’s a lot easier picturing Geno Smith, Brock Bowers, Jakobi Meyers and Ashton Jeanty being the team’s initial spark, but the defense must answer a lot of questions. After Christian Wilkins’ release, there’s less talent up front.

Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins
Tua Tagovailoa has been sharp early in practice, which obviously has been a welcome sign. But he also earned rightful praise for calling out Tyreek Hill and demanding more accountability from the star receiver. Either Hill is on board with the team, or he’s not. The offense regaining its mojo is the best path for this team remaining relevant. There’s hope the run game can rebound, and Jaylen Waddle has been an early camp standout. I think this offense can still thrive. But the defense worries me, especially in the secondary. An already-shorthanded unit has taken some lumps. There’s an argument for a bounce-back season ... but also enough concerns about the team heading in the wrong direction. I’m in a holding pattern for now.

Tennessee Titans
Tennessee Titans
This is a big move up. Perhaps it’s a bit of a projection, with a bit of an overcorrection. I started the Commanders in this same spot a year ago when my spidey sense started kicking in with Jayden Daniels. I am getting that same kind of feeling with Cam Ward. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a 12-5 season in Nashville, not with the toughest-looking schedule in the division. And besides, the Titans have been bad at home the past three years, so they clearly need to show they can reverse that. But Ward’s presence eventually can lift all boats. He’s not the dynamic scrambler Daniels is, but he has some exciting arm talent and a receiver in Calvin Ridley who seems energized again. Can they help compensate for some weaker spots on the roster? Not entirely. But I think we’ll exit this season feeling good about Ward and the direction of the Titans.

Indianapolis Colts
Indianapolis Colts
True quarterback battles are rarer these days, but it appears the Colts have a real one going on. Neither Anthony Richardson nor Daniel Jones has been able to take a pronounced lead in the competition; both passers yo-yo back and forth with encouraging practices followed by tougher ones. It’s good they’re pushing each other, and it’s great to see Richardson stack some stronger performances. Will one of them be ready to take control of the offense by Week 1? That’s the big question. With improved QB play, the Colts might be a competitive team in the relatively open AFC South. Tyler Warren also appears to be the kind of precocious rookie who can immediately help whoever wins the job, and WR Adonai Mitchell might be poised for a breakout. Let’s see if this offense can find an identity and show some productivity. I’m a little leery, but not hopeless.

Carolina Panthers
Carolina Panthers
I like that there’s more juice in the receiver room. First-rounder Tetaroia McMillan has flashed some skill amid inconsistencies. Fellow rookie Jimmy Horn Jr. has opened eyes as a playmaker, too. Xavier Legette looks poised for more in Year 2, and Jalen Coker can build on an impressive rookie season. Adam Thielen and David Moore remain, and Hunter Renfrow is doing his best to revive his career. These are all positives for Bryce Young’s development. But I also worry that Carolina didn’t quite do enough defensively this offseason to challenge in the NFC South. The Panthers were awful in nearly every major defensive category last season, although it at least appears that they’ll get a better push and rush up front after being dominated in the trenches a year ago.

New York Jets
New York Jets
It’s no surprise that Aaron Glenn is running a tough camp. It’s also not surprising that early camp breadcrumbs indicate this will be a team predicated first and foremost on the run game and controlling the ball and the clock. That was a problem last season, when the Jets were minus-2 in turnovers, 22nd in first downs per game and 27th in time of possession. They have the personnel to pull this new look off, with three quality backs (Breece Hall, Braelon Allen and Isaiah Davis), a running quarterback in Justin Fields and an offensive line that should be able to move people. Whether that turns into a winning formula remains to be seen, but it’s something that allows the defense to be more aggressive than it was under the previous regime. The Jets face a daunting road schedule this season, but this approach could help get them back to respectability. I’m moderately encouraged but realistic about their chances.

New York Giants
New York Giants
There had to be some major breath-holding when Malik Nabers was banged up with a shoulder injury early in camp. It appears he’ll be fine, and Nabers was tearing up camp when he got hurt, looking like a superstar in need of a supporting cast. Wide receiver looks thin after him. The offensive line remains an area of some question. Offensively, the Giants are still taking shape, with a wait-and-see approach at quarterback. There are some positives, I think. I like the potential of the defense, especially up front, even if the secondary worries me a bit. The rookies appear to be holding their own -- wait until you see Abdul Carter play real games -- and what looks like a strong first-year class could be a great one if QB Jaxson Dart does anything in Year 1. There’s excitement but still too few players at or near Nabers’ level. That, along with a wicked schedule, has capped my enthusiasm.

Kellen Moore said he was in no rush to name a QB starter, rotating his three options prior to the preseason opener vs. the Chargers. By the end of this week, we might have a better idea of which quarterback will start Week 1. Right now, it still feels like a three-man race. The Saints also have battles on the offensive line, in the secondary and at kicker, and there’s little clarity on those, too. Tyrann Mathieu’s pre-camp retirement was a shock and a blow. There are some fading stars, such as Cameron Jordan and Taysom Hill (currently on the PUP list), and some young players staring at the crossroads of their careers. I figured Moore would be up against it in Year 1, and that’s very much proving to be true. Until there is some quarterback clarity, it’s a dim outlook -- and even declaring a winner in that race might not bring much sunshine.

Cleveland Browns
It’s hard to say it has been a banner camp for the Browns. First, second-round pick Quinshon Judkins was arrested a few weeks before the team reported (and the rookie running back hasn’t participated in team activities since). Then Kenny Pickett got hurt, throwing a wrench into the team’s four-QB jamboree, and then CB Martin Emerson suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. So far, it’s hard to know how the QB battle will end up, as neither Dillon Gabriel nor Shedeur Sanders have yet been able to make a big move. There also are questions about the RB and WR rotations and just how many weapons will be at the quarterbacks’ disposal after Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku. Defensively, the Browns could be competitive, but the unit has to be a lot better than it was last season. There’s just too much up in the air for this team right now to believe good things are imminent on the horizon.
