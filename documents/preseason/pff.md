Arizona Cardinals
Biggest Strength: Rushing Attack
With their use of multiple tight end sets, a powerful offensive line and a stable of dynamic ball carriers, the Cardinals’ rushing attack remains the foundation of their offense. 

Biggest Weakness: Linebackers
Arizona focused much of its offseason on upgrading the defensive line, but the secondary remains a work in progress, and the linebacker unit stands out as the defense’s biggest question mark. 

Bottom Line
Arizona could be on the cusp of playoff contention if Kyler Murray finds more week-to-week consistency and the team’s defensive additions deliver as hoped.

Atlanta Falcons
Biggest Strength: Offensive Line
Despite losing standout center Drew Dalman in free agency, Atlanta still features one of the NFL’s top offensive lines, particularly in the run game. 

Biggest Weakness: Pass Rush
The Falcons ranked among the bottom three teams in the NFL last season in pass-rush grade, pressure rate, and pass-rush win rate. Limited by cap space, their only notable free-agent addition was Leonard Floyd, who posted just a 54.5 pass-rush grade in 2024.

Bottom Line
Atlanta has the offensive firepower to contend for an NFC South title. For that to happen, Michael Penix Jr. must deliver over a full season, and the team’s young pass rushers will need to help shore up last year’s biggest weakness.

Baltimore Ravens
Biggest Strength: Rushing Offense
Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson formed a historically great rushing duo in 2024, powering the Ravens to a 94.5 team PFF rushing grade — the highest single-season mark in PFF history.

Biggest Weakness: Edge Rushers
Baltimore is still searching for a breakout star on the edge. While the Ravens' edge defender group is solid, no individual posted a pass-rush grade above 74.7 last season. As a unit, they ranked outside the top 20 in both pressure rate and pass-rush win rate.

Bottom Line
The Ravens have everything they need to compete for a championship. They just need to come through in big postseason moments against the gauntlet of contenders in the AFC.

Read Full Team Preview
Buffalo Bills
Biggest Strength: Josh Allen
Buffalo’s MVP-winning quarterback remains the foundation of the team’s success. Despite a defense that ranked 28th in PFF grade last season and a receiving corps that finished 17th without a true elite option, Josh Allen continued to carry the Bills into Super Bowl contention.

Biggest Weakness: Safeties
The Bills posted the second-worst coverage grade in the NFL last season, with many of their issues stemming from defending the middle of the field. Buffalo’s safeties ranked 31st in coverage and return largely the same group in 2025.

Bottom Line
As long as Josh Allen is healthy, the Bills will remain favorites to win the AFC East. Their championship hopes, however, hinge on whether the defense — a unit that has consistently underwhelmed in the postseason — can take a meaningful step forward.

Read Full Team Preview
Carolina Panthers
Biggest Strength: Offensive Line
Carolina spent significant resources improving its offensive line last offseason, particularly on the interior with the additions of guards Damien Lewis and Robert Hunt. The result was a unit that ranked seventh in the NFL in PFF grade last season and gave Bryce Young a chance to succeed from the pocket.

Biggest Weakness: Defensive Front
Carolina’s front seven was its biggest weakness last season and will be under the microscope heading into 2025. The defensive line should take a step forward with the additions of several veterans and rookies Princely Umanmielen, Nic Scourton and Cam'Ron Jackson, as well as the return of Derrick Brown.

Bottom Line
Bryce Young’s development and improvement in the front seven are the two most important factors for Carolina’s success this season. If both materialize, the Panthers could become a sneaky contender in the NFC South.

Read Full Team Preview
Chicago Bears
Biggest Strength: Offensive Line
Chicago already had a solid tackle duo in Darnell Wright and Braxton Jones, who ranked 16th and 22nd, respectively, among qualified tackles in PFF grade last season. The team then overhauled its interior offensive line this offseason by acquiring Joe Thuney, Drew Dalman and Jonah Jackson.

Biggest Weakness: Running Back
Running back is the only offensive position where the Bears didn’t make a major addition this offseason. Chicago’s running backs ranked 26th in PFF rushing grade and 32nd in yards after contact per attempt last season. 

Bottom Line
Few quarterbacks face more pressure this season than Caleb Williams. The supporting cast around him is significantly improved, and if his production begins to match his elite talent, Chicago could contend for a playoff spot.

Read Full Team Preview
Cincinnati Bengals
Biggest strength: Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins
When Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins are all on the field, the Bengals can compete with anyone. Cincinnati went 8-4 in games where the trio was healthy and active.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Line
Subpar offensive line play has been a constant throughout Joe Burrow’s tenure in Cincinnati. The Bengals' offensive line has finished in the bottom five in PFF grade in four of Burrow’s five seasons, including a 2024 campaign that saw them rank 29th in both PFF pass-blocking and PFF run-blocking grades.

Bottom Line
With Burrow, Chase and Higgins, the Bengals can compete with anyone. But to make the leap from playoff hopeful to true Super Bowl contender, they need a more reliable offensive line and greater consistency on defense.

Read Full Team Preview
Cleveland Browns
Biggest Strength: Defensive Line
One constant for the Browns is a dominant defensive line led by Myles Garrett. The unit ranked second in the NFL in PFF grade last season, trailing only Pittsburgh, and was the league’s only defensive line to finish in the top five in both PFF pass-rush and PFF run-defense grades.

Biggest Weakness: Quarterback
The Browns are in the early stages of searching for their long-term answer at quarterback. This season’s group includes 40-year-old Joe Flacco and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.

Bottom Line
Myles Garrett and the defense should keep the Browns competitive, but the team must find stability at quarterback and along the offensive line to generate enough wins for a legitimate postseason push.

Read Full Team Preview
Dallas Cowboys
Biggest Strength: Pass Rush
Although elite edge defender Micah Parsons is gone, the Cowboys are at their most dangerous when forcing opponents into obvious passing situations. Despite Parsons' four missed games last season, Dallas still ranked fourth in the NFL in PFF pass-rush grade. Osa Odighizuwa contributed 60 interior pressures, and the team bolstered its pass-rushing depth this offseason with additions such as Dante Fowler Jr. and second-round rookie Donovan Ezeiruaku.

Biggest Weakness: Run Defense
The Cowboys’ run defense lagged well behind their pass rush in 2024, finishing ahead of only Carolina in team run-defense grade. The main issue was a lack of impact at the line of scrimmage — Micah Parsons, now with the Packers, led all Dallas defensive linemen in run-defense grade at only 65.5. With no major additions outside of potential contributions from rookie Donovan Ezeiruaku, the Cowboys will need improved play from last year’s core to shore up this weakness.

Bottom Line
With Micah Parsons off to Green Bay, it remains to be seen if the Cowboys have enough star power to reach the postseason. Dak Prescott will need to prove last year’s struggles were an outlier, and questions about the team's ability to run the ball and stop the run could place a hard cap on how far they can advance if they get there.

Read Full Team Preview
Denver Broncos
Biggest Strength: Offensive Line
The Broncos return all five starters from an offensive line that led the NFL in PFF pass-blocking grade last season. The group allowed a league-best 16.2% pressure rate and a 3.7% knockdown rate, which ranked fourth.

Biggest Weakness: Receiving Depth
The Broncos need a pass-catching option beyond Courtland Sutton after ranking 28th in PFF receiving grade last season — the lowest mark of any team that won more than seven games in 2024. One potential boost could come from new tight end Evan Engram, as Denver’s tight ends posted a league-worst 48.0 PFF receiving grade last year.

Bottom Line
Denver boasts a potentially elite defense, a quarterback who protects the football and a future Hall-of-Fame head coach. Already ahead of schedule after making the postseason last year, the Broncos should expect to return in 2025. The ceiling of this team will depend on the impact of its offensive skill players.

Detroit Lions
Biggest Strength: Explosive Offense
The Lions are facing some turnover on offense with a new offensive coordinator and an inexperienced interior offensive line. However, they still possess a top-10 quarterback, the second-ranked running back unit in the NFL, an excellent receiving corps and one of the best tackle duos in the league.

Biggest Weakness: Pass-Rush Depth
Aidan Hutchinson’s season-ending injury derailed the Lions’ pass rush last season. Through Week 6, Detroit led the NFL in PFF pass-rush grade as a unit led by Hutchinson, who was pacing the league with a 95.0 PFF pass-rush grade himself. After Hutchinson’s injury, the Lions produced the fourth-worst PFF pass-rush grade in the NFL.

Bottom Line
The Lions are talented enough to compete at the top of the NFC, but they enter 2025 with more questions than in previous seasons. Their lack of depth in the trenches and transition to two new coordinators could cause them some difficulty in a tough division.

Read Full Team Preview
Green Bay Packers
Biggest Strength: Pass Protection
The Packers' passing game was a bit inconsistent last season, but their pass protection wasn’t to blame. The team ranked third in the NFL in PFF pass-blocking grade, and their quarterbacks were sacked just 24 times in 18 games — only 13 of which were charged to the offensive line.

Biggest Weakness: Cornerbacks
The Packers’ cornerback unit appears shaky heading into the 2025 season, particularly after the loss of veterans Jaire Alexander and Eric Stokes. Carrington Valentine played reasonably well down the stretch last season.

Bottom Line
Green Bay has turned in a winning campaign and a playoff appearance in five of the past six seasons. The team should be expected to do so again, but it needs to find consistency through the air, both on offense and defense, to take the next step toward Super Bowl contention.

Read Full Team Preview
Houston Texans
Biggest strength: Pass Defense
Houston possesses a fearsome pass defense that ranked in the top 10 in PFF pass-rush and coverage grades last season. Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter led the way on the defensive line, each ranking among the top 20 edge rushers in PFF pass-rush grade and pressures. The Texans' secondary features an outstanding cornerback duo in Derek Stingley Jr. and Kamari Lassiter, each of whom placed among the top 12 cornerbacks in PFF coverage grade in 2024.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Line
Houston’s offensive line became its Achilles' heel as the 2024 season wore on. That unit ranked just 25th in PFF grade, and C.J. Stroud took the second-most sacks in the NFL. The front office has since traded star left tackle Laremy Tunsil to Washington, leaving the unit without a single player who graded above 70.2 last season. 

Bottom Line
Houston currently has the best quarterback and best defense in the AFC South, which gives the team major advantages over its division rivals. However, the Texans' weaknesses on the offensive line and in run defense could pose problems for them once again when playing the AFC's elite teams.

Indianapolis Colts
Biggest Strength: Pass Catchers
Colts head coach Shane Steichen certainly has no shortage of weapons to deploy in the passing game. Slot receiver Josh Downs finished 2024 with an 85.1 PFF receiving grade (11th best in the NFL), Michael Pittman Jr. has earned at least a 70.0 PFF receiving grade in four straight seasons, Alec Pierce ranked 11th in the NFL with a 99.1 deep PFF receiving grade last year, and Adonai Mitchell and rookie tight end Tyler Warren also figure to be factors.

Biggest Weakness: Quarterback
The Colts held an open competition between Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones at quarterback, and Jones came out on top. Still, Richardson has posted a 58.7 PFF passing grade while completing just 50.6% of his passes across his two NFL seasons, and Jones isn’t as athletic and owns the lowest big-time throw rate of any quarterback with at least 700 dropbacks since 2021. 

Bottom Line
Indianapolis has enough weapons on offense to compete for a postseason berth. The team's quarterback situation needs to be ironed out, though, and the defense will be adjusting to life under new defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. If neither Richardson nor Jones emerges as a viable starter, the organization is likely to focus on a new option in the 2026 NFL Draft.

Read Full Team Preview
Jacksonville Jaguars
Biggest Strength: Wide Receivers
Jacksonville could soon have one of the NFL’s best wide receiver duos: 2024 rookie sensation Brian Thomas Jr. and 2025 first-round pick Travis Hunter. Thomas stunned the league by turning in an 83.4 PFF receiving grade, a top-20 mark, last season. Meanwhile, Hunter's 89.0 PFF receiving grade placed seventh in the FBS last season despite his playing nearly 800 snaps at cornerback.

Biggest Weakness: Secondary
The Jaguars may need rookie Travis Hunter to help out in the secondary, considering their struggles last season. The team ranked 26th in PFF coverage grade, and their deficiencies at safety were particularly costly. That unit ranked dead last in PFF coverage grade.

Bottom Line
An offensive mastermind in Liam Coen, a healthy Trevor Lawrence and the addition of Travis Hunter give Jacksonville hopes for a bounce-back. However, they need major improvements on the offensive line and in the secondary to jump into AFC South contention.

Read Full Team Preview
Kansas City Chiefs
Biggest Strength: Defense
Kansas City lacked offensive explosiveness last season, but the team's defense was up to the task. The Chiefs earned the second-highest PFF defensive grade in the NFL, ranking behind only their Super Bowl opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Line
For the second time in five seasons, the Chiefs’ biggest question mark is their offensive line. Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith are two excellent interior players, but Kansas City needs to improve at both tackle spots and left guard.

Bottom Line
The Chiefs’ core is still intact — Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes and a stellar defense. They are the best situational football team in the league, having gone 12-0 in one-score games last season. That may regress, but it’s still hard not to see the Chiefs as prime AFC contenders, considering their success in the Mahomes era.

Read Full Team Preview
Las Vegas Raiders
Biggest Strength: Offensive Improvement
The Raiders ranked 31st in PFF passing grade and 32nd in PFF rushing grade last season. They made an effort this offseason to address that by acquiring quarterback Geno Smith and drafting running back Ashton Jeanty.

Biggest Weakness: Pass Defense
Las Vegas’ 32.0 team PFF coverage grade last season was tied for the lowest earned by any franchise in the past four seasons. None of their projected veteran starters at cornerback, safety or linebacker earned a 65.0 PFF coverage grade last season.

Bottom Line
The additions of Geno Smith, Ashton Jeanty and multiple rookie receivers should immediately improve the Raiders’ offense in Pete Carroll’s first season as head coach. However, their lack of defensive talent, particularly in coverage, likely puts a hard cap on the number of wins they can secure in an extremely tough division.

Read Full Team Preview
Los Angeles Chargers
Biggest Strength: Secondary
The Chargers’ outstanding secondary propelled the team to a No. 2 ranking in PFF coverage grade last season. They also allowed the third-lowest rate of explosive pass plays.

Biggest Weakness: Receiving Depth
Wide receiver Ladd McConkey was outstanding in his rookie season, but the Chargers are searching for pass-catching depth behind him. Joshua Palmer departed in free agency, while Quentin Johnston and Keenan Allen both earned 68.2 PFF receiving grades last season.

Bottom Line
Rashawn Slater’s season-ending injury is very concerning, but Jim Harbaugh has yet to have a losing season as an NFL head coach. The Chargers are still plenty talented enough to compete for a postseason berth.

Read Full Team Preview
Los Angeles Rams
Biggest Strength: Pass Catchers
The Rams carried the NFL’s highest-graded wide receiver unit last season and could be even better in 2025. Puka Nacua led the NFL in PFF receiving grade despite missing six games. Los Angeles let Cooper Kupp depart but picked up Davante Adams, who earned a 76.8 PFF receiving grade last season. Tutu Atwell and Jordan Whittington are also viable options, as is a deep tight end room that features Tyler Higbee, Colby Parkinson and second-round rookie Terrance Ferguson.

Biggest Weakness: Pass Protection
The Rams’ pass protection, or lack thereof, was often the biggest determinant of their success in 2024. They ranked 30th as a team in PFF pass-blocking grade and lost seven of the 11 games in which they earned a sub-62.5 PFF pass-blocking grade.

Bottom Line
The health of Matthew Stafford and Alaric Jackson could be the keys to the Rams’ season. They need their starting quarterback on the field and for their offensive line to keep him healthy. If that happens, they can be Super Bowl contenders. If either or both of those things falter, they could miss the postseason entirely.

Read Full Team Preview
Miami Dolphins
Biggest Strength: Speed on Offense
Miami’s ideal offense creates explosive plays at a high rate with a haul of speedsters at running back and wide receiver. De'Von Achane has recorded a 92.2 PFF rushing grade over the past two years, placing him second best in the NFL. Behind Achane is Jaylen Wright, who posted a solid 75.8 PFF rushing grade as a rookie. On the perimeter, Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle combine to form one of the most explosive receiver pairings in the NFL. 

Biggest Weakness: Cornerbacks
Dolphins cornerbacks earned just a 64.2 PFF coverage grade last season. The two players who kept the unit afloat last season will not suit up for the team this year, as Jalen Ramsey was traded to Pittsburgh and Kader Kohou suffered a season-ending knee injury.

Bottom Line
If Tua Tagovailoa can play all 17 games, which he’s done just once, then the Dolphins have enough offensive firepower to compete for a playoff spot. Their flaws on the offensive line and in the secondary could prevent that, though, along with any potential injuries to their starting quarterback.

Read Full Team Preview
Minnesota Vikings
Biggest Strength: Offensive Supporting Cast
J.J. McCarthy is entering his first season as Minnesota’s starting quarterback, and he couldn’t ask for a better supporting cast. Including the postseason, Aaron Jones racked up more than 1,600 yards from scrimmage last season. Led by Justin Jefferson, the Vikings ranked fourth in the NFL in PFF receiving grade. The team also revamped its interior offensive line and could boast one of the NFL’s best units up front if Christian Darrisaw and Will Fries stay healthy.

Biggest Weakness: Unproven Quarterback
Despite his outstanding supporting cast, McCarthy is the biggest question mark for the Vikings this season. That’s not to say he can’t succeed, but his NFL resume consists of just a handful of preseason snaps.

Bottom Line
Kevin O'Connell’s play-calling wizardry and outstanding offensive personnel should give J.J. McCarthy a chance to succeed early in his career. Brian Flores brings similar potential with his talented defense. Despite having a first-year starting quarterback, Minnesota should be squarely in postseason contention again this season.

Read Full Team Preview
New England Patriots
Biggest Strength: Defense
The Patriots leveraged their financial resources to enhance their defense this offseason and appear to now possess a unit with legitimate stars at all three levels. Former Eagle Milton Williams, who led the NFL in PFF pass-rush grade in 2024, and a healthy Christian Barmore could form a dominant interior duo.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Line
The Patriots’ offensive line was the lowest-graded unit in the league by nearly 10 points. The hope this season is that several new contributors will turn the unit's fortunes around.

Bottom Line
The Patriots enter the 2025 season with an improved roster and coaching staff. They should win more than the four games that they did last season, but any postseason hopes rest with the development of Drake Maye and a very young offense that will take time to jell.

Read Full Team Preview
New Orleans Saints
Biggest Strength: Pass Catchers
The Saints may have a tumultuous quarterback situation, but whoever wins the starting job shouldn’t have a shortage of receiving options. Chris Olave is one of the best pass catchers in the NFL. Rashid Shaheed and Brandin Cooks are both credible deep threats. Juwan Johnson, Foster Moreau and Taysom Hill comprise an interesting tight end room, though the latter two are still recovering from injuries. Alvin Kamara is still one of the most reliable receivers in the NFL out of the backfield.

Biggest Weakness: Run Defense
New Orleans struggled mightily to stop the run last season, tying for the second-worst PFF run-defense grade in the NFL. Much of those struggles could be attributed to their interior defensive line, where none of their four qualified players earned above a 50.0 PFF run-defense grade last season.

Bottom Line
Considering their struggles in the trenches and shaky quarterback situation, the Saints are likely to use 2025 as a developmental year to discover their foundational players in Kellen Moore’s first season as head coach.

Read Full Team Preview
New York Giants
Biggest Strength: Defensive Line
New York’s defensive line has the potential to be a matchup nightmare. Dexter Lawrence is the NFL’s highest-graded defensive tackle over the past three seasons, and he anchors a front that could be among the league’s best.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Line
Questions remain about the Giants’ offensive line after the unit finished 28th in PFF grade last season — and most of the group returns. A healthy Andrew Thomas at left tackle would be a major boost after two injury-plagued years. Veterans Jon Runyan and Greg Van Roten are back at guard, but both graded below average in 2024. Center John Michael Schmitz Jr. posted the fourth-lowest PFF pass-blocking grade among qualified players at his position, and right tackle Jermaine Eluemunor has earned a 70.0-plus PFF overall grade in just one of his eight seasons.

Bottom Line
The Giants have a wealth of defensive potential and a significantly improved quarterback situation. If their offensive line can find a way to improve upon last season’s poor performance, New York is a dark-horse playoff contender. If that unit doesn’t perform well, the offense could stagnate too often for them to win games.

Read Full Team Preview
New York Jets
Biggest Strength: Offensive Line
If first-round tackles Olu Fashanu and Armand Membou live up to expectations, the Jets could soon feature one of the NFL’s top offensive lines. Fashanu earned a solid 74.7 PFF pass-blocking grade last season at left tackle and will stay on the blind side in New York. Membou, meanwhile, ranked third among all FBS tackles in overall grade (90.6) at Missouri.

Biggest Weakness: Receiving Depth
Garrett Wilson ranks among the NFL’s elite wide receivers, but the Jets lack proven pass-catching depth behind him. No other player on the roster surpassed 530 receiving yards at the NFL level last season.

Bottom Line
Aaron Glenn’s top priority in his first year as head coach is reshaping the culture and mindset of the Jets’ organization. If that transformation includes a jump in the win column, it will likely be driven by a resurgent defense and more consistent play from quarterback Justin Fields.

Read Full Team Preview
Philadelphia Eagles
Biggest Strength: Defense
In Vic Fangio’s first year as defensive coordinator, the Eagles fielded the highest-graded defense in the NFL — and it wasn’t particularly close. Philadelphia ranked first or second in team PFF run-defense grade, PFF pass-rush grade and PFF coverage grade.

Biggest Weakness: Passing Game Consistency
The Eagles had few flaws during their championship run, but passing-game consistency wasn’t always a strength. Much of that centered around Jalen Hurts, who played lights-out in the final two postseason games but finished the regular season ranked just 23rd in PFF passing grade.

Bottom Line
Armed with arguably the best roster in the NFL, the Eagles enter 2025 with minimal personnel concerns. There may be a transitional period on offense following Kellen Moore’s departure to New Orleans, but with elite talent on both sides of the ball, Philadelphia has every reason to expect another deep postseason run.

Read Full Team Preview
Pittsburgh Steelers
Biggest Strength: Pass Rush
Pittsburgh’s pass rush is arguably the most fearsome defensive unit in the NFL. Not only do they have elite talents like T.J. Watt and Cam Heyward, but they also bring considerable depth.

Biggest Weakness: Offensive Tackles
Pittsburgh’s young offensive tackles will face heavy scrutiny this season as they are tasked with protecting their 41-year-old quarterback. Broderick Jones is slated to move to left tackle after earning sub-60.0 PFF overall grades on the right side in each of his first two seasons. Second-year man Troy Fautanu played just one game last season before suffering a season-ending knee injury. He’s projected to start at right tackle, where he has logged fewer than 100 snaps across his college and NFL careers. 

Bottom Line
Pittsburgh’s defense should be an elite unit following additions to the secondary. The questions for this team reside on offense with an aging quarterback and a lack of clarity at running back, wide receiver and offensive tackle. If the Steelers protect Rodgers well enough, they have the makings of a playoff team.

Read Full Team Preview
San Francisco 49ers
Biggest Strength: Offensive Star Power
When healthy — a big caveat of late — the 49ers have as much offensive firepower as any NFL team. Brock Purdy is an above-average starting quarterback. Christian McCaffrey was the best running back in the NFL in 2023. Brandon Aiyuk, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall comprise a solid group of young wide receivers. George Kittle is the best tight end in the NFL, and the offensive line is a solid unit headlined by Trent Williams and Dominick Puni.

Biggest Weakness: Defensive Line
Beyond Nick Bosa, San Francisco lacks proven defensive line depth. The front office drafted three such players to fill that void, but they will likely take some time before being considered a remedy. Otherwise, the team is working with veterans like Yetur Gross-Matos, Kevin Givens and Jordan Elliott, all of whom struggled to perform last season, especially in run defense.

Bottom Line
A return to full health and a relatively easy schedule can bring the 49ers back to the postseason. However, their defense is extremely young, especially up front, and they will have to answer early-season questions about the health of their running backs and wide receivers.

Read Full Team Preview
Seattle Seahawks
Biggest Strength: Secondary
Mike Macdonald has a talented, versatile secondary to work as the foundation of his defense. Third-year man Devon Witherspoon has already proven himself to be one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, playing either outside or in the slot. Riq Woolen has racked up 11 interceptions and 28 pass breakups in his first three seasons. Julian Love earned a career-high 82.2 PFF overall grade last season. And the team added the uber-athletic Nick Emmanwori in the second round of this year’s draft.

Biggest Weakness: Interior Offensive Line
Seattle’s lack of a productive interior offensive line sank its 2024 season. That unit ranked 24th in PFF run-blocking grade and 29th in PFF pass-blocking grade while allowing the fifth-highest pressure rate in the NFL.

Bottom Line
Seattle’s underrated defense is a unit to watch this season. The offensive line needs to protect Darnold well enough to balance out this team. If they can do that and Darnold plays close to as well as he did last season, then there is postseason potential in Seattle. Things could be bumpy early, though, if the offensive line struggles to coalesce.

Read Full Team Preview
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Biggest Strength: Offensive Balance
Tampa Bay was a top-eight team in PFF passing grade, PFF rushing grade, PFF receiving grade and PFF pass-blocking grade last season. The only other squad to accomplish that feat was the Baltimore Ravens.

Biggest Weakness: Middle-of-the-Field Coverage
An unusually mediocre season from Antoine Winfield Jr. and coverage struggles at linebacker exposed the Buccaneers’ weaknesses in the middle of the field. When defending throws in the middle-third of the field, Tampa Bay ranked 26th in PFF coverage grade, 29th in EPA allowed per pass and 31st in passer rating allowed.

Bottom Line
The Buccaneers and their explosive offense are built to win the NFC South again as long as they can adjust to new offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard. Their ability to improve upon last year’s defensive performance will determine whether they can make a deep postseason run.

Read Full Team Preview
Tennessee Titans
Biggest Strength: Interior Defensive Line
Tennessee’s defensive tackles ranked second in the NFL in PFF overall grade last season while leading the league in PFF run-defense grade by a wide margin. The star was Jeffery Simmons, who placed ninth in PFF overall grade and racked up 45 pressures.

Biggest Weakness: Linebackers
Five linebackers played at least 200 snaps last season for the Titans, and none remain on their 2025 roster. The team's only linebacker with significant experience is Cody Barton, who posted a 64.3 PFF overall grade last season in Denver.

Bottom Line
Barring a Jayden Daniels-esque performance, Cam Ward’s development is likely to be the headline story for the Titans this season. If he shows promise, then the team can begin to fill holes at wide receiver, tight end, edge defender and linebacker next offseason.

Read Full Team Preview
Washington Commanders
Biggest Strength: Offensive Skill Players
Armed with an elite young quarterback, multiple rushing threats and a potentially dynamic receiving corps, the Commanders should possess a high-flying offense once again in 2024.

Biggest Weakness: Defensive Line
Washington’s defense has some catching up to do relative to the team's offense. The greatest concern is a defensive line that finished 31st in the NFL in PFF grade last season. 

Bottom Line
Expectations are rightfully high in Washington, led by Jayden Daniels and newcomers Laremy Tunsil and Deebo Samuel to an already potent offense. If Dan Quinn can improve the defense, the Commanders could be Super Bowl contenders. The defensive line and cornerbacks will be the units to watch that could make the difference.
