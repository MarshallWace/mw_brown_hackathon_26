# 2025 NFL Season Predictions

The start of the 2025 NFL season is just days away, which means it's time to make some predictions.

My favorite part of making predictions is when people throw them back in my face at the end of the season, but that won't be happening this year, because I don't plan on getting anything wrong. That being said, if you do want to make fun of my predictions, you can send all your hate messages to me on X.

Before we get to my predictions, let me explain how things are going to work here: I'm going to go through each division and predict each team's final record. After that, I'll be making one bold prediction for each division.

Once you roll through the divisional portion of these predictions, you'll see my playoff picks and eventually the team I'm picking to win the Super Bowl. In two of the past nine years, my preseason Super Bowl pick has ended up winning it all, so if you want to skip everything and scroll straight down to my Super Bowl pick, I won't be offended.

Finally, if you're wondering how I did last season, I predicted eight out of the 14 teams that made the playoffs. I also correctly predicted the Rams would win the NFC West. On the other hand, I completely whiffed on the Bills, who very much did make the playoffs.

This year, I made sure not to eat any Buffalo wings before making my picks.

Alright, let's get to the 2025 predictions.

## AFC East
1. **Bills:** 13-4*  
2. **Patriots:** 10-7*  
3. Dolphins: 7-10  
4. Jets: 5-12  

**AFC East bold prediction:** Mike Vrabel wins Coach of the Year after leading the Patriots to the playoffs.

Vrabel has built his reputation on tough, disciplined defense, and the Patriots have given him the personnel to do just that. New England added Milton Williams, Carlton Davis, Harold Landry and Robert Spillane, forming the core of a dangerous defense. Add in Drake Maye — possibly the best quarterback Vrabel has ever coached — and the Patriots look primed for a big leap.

The Patriots also have the easiest strength of schedule in the AFC, and the team with the easiest AFC schedule has finished with a winning record in seven straight seasons.

## AFC North
1. **Ravens:** 12-5*  
2. **Bengals:** 11-6*  
3. Steelers: 9-8  
4. Browns: 5-12  

**AFC North bold prediction:** Ravens second-round pick Mike Green wins Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Green is in a perfect situation to rack up sacks in a division filled with quarterbacks who take a lot of hits, including Aaron Rodgers, Joe Burrow and Joe Flacco. With pass rushers dominating this award in recent years, Green fits the trend perfectly.

---

## AFC South
1. **Texans:** 9-8*  
2. Colts: 8-9  
3. Jaguars: 7-10  
4. Titans: 3-14  

**AFC South bold prediction:** Daniel Jones wins more games than Trevor Lawrence.

This feels like a make-or-break year for Trevor Lawrence, who is just 2-13 in his past 15 starts. If Daniel Jones can win more games in Indianapolis than Lawrence does in Jacksonville, it would be a brutal indictment of the former No. 1 overall pick.

---

## AFC West
1. **Chiefs:** 12-5*  
2. **Broncos:** 10-7*  
3. Chargers: 8-9  
4. Raiders: 7-10  

**AFC West bold prediction:** RJ Harvey wins Offensive Rookie of the Year.

Sean Payton has a long history of maximizing rookie running backs, from Reggie Bush to Alvin Kamara. If Payton spent premium draft capital on Harvey, he plans to use him — a lot.

---

## NFC East
1. **Eagles:** 12-5*  
2. **Commanders:** 10-7*  
3. Cowboys: 8-9  
4. Giants: 5-12  

**NFC East bold prediction:** The NFC East has its first repeat champion since 2004.

The Eagles are the clear favorite, and every other team in the division has at least one glaring weakness. This feels like the year history finally breaks.

---

## NFC North
1. **Packers:** 11-6*  
2. Lions: 9-8  
3. Vikings: 8-9  
4. Bears: 7-10  

**NFC North bold prediction:** The Vikings’ gamble on J.J. McCarthy goes south.

Minnesota is handing the keys to a quarterback with zero career starts, questionable receiver health and minimal chemistry. Only one team in the past 20 years has gone under .500 after winning 14 games — the bold call is that Minnesota becomes the second.

---

## NFC South
1. **Buccaneers:** 10-7*  
2. Falcons: 8-9  
3. Panthers: 5-12  
4. Saints: 3-14  

**NFC South bold prediction:** Baker Mayfield leads the NFL in passing yards.

Mayfield is coming off a career year and now adds rookie Emeka Egbuka to a receiving group that already includes Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. A 5,000-yard season isn’t out of the question.

---

## NFC West
1. **49ers:** 13-4*  
2. **Cardinals:** 10-7*  
3. Rams: 9-8  
4. Seahawks: 8-9  

**NFC West bold prediction:** Brock Purdy wins MVP.

The MVP formula is simple: be a quarterback and play for an elite team. With a healthy roster and the league’s easiest schedule, Purdy checks both boxes and could finally get the respect he deserves.

## Super Bowl LX (Levi’s Stadium)

**Bold playoff prediction:** The 49ers win the Super Bowl in their home stadium.

Despite Kyle Shanahan’s painful Super Bowl history, this roster — especially with Robert Saleh back running the defense — feels capable of finishing the job.

**Super Bowl LX prediction:**  
**49ers 27, Ravens 24**
