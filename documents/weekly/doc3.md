The winners and losers from Championship Sunday are, at least on the surface, fairly obvious. If you're going to play in the Super Bowl in two weeks — see: the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks — you are definitely a winner. But there's a lot of nuance to even the most binary of outcomes, and that's what we're focused on after the penultimate Sunday of the season.

## Winners

### 1) Patriots quarterback Drake Maye's legs
Maye ran 10 times for 65 yards, but those runs had an outsized impact on the 10-7 win over Denver. Five of them went for first downs, one — a 6-yard quarterback draw — was the Patriots' only touchdown, and the final one, with just under two minutes to go and the Patriots trying to run out the clock, was a bootleg that required Maye to change direction on the only visible patch of grass and went for 7 yards, essentially ending the game.

It was a miserable day for throwing the ball — he completed just 10 passes for 86 yards — but Maye's legs are a weapon not to be overlooked.

### 2) The weather in Denver
The game started in clear conditions and devolved, by the fourth quarter, into a blizzard. The kickers missed four field-goal attempts (two each). Players slipped, passes hung up in the wind, and visibility declined.

Some will say a game this messy is a good argument for domed stadiums. Nope. Figuring out how to manage in any conditions is part of the game and part of what the Patriots did better on Sunday.

### 3) Patriots defense
The Broncos had just 181 yards of offense, and that was the continuation of a dominating Patriots defense. New England has defeated three playoff teams that had top-five total defenses (Chargers, Texans and Broncos) on the back of that unit.

The Pats offense has averaged just 16 points per game this postseason, but New England has allowed just 26 points total in three games.

### 4) Patriots organization
A lot of people around the country dreaded this, but a tip of the cap to a team that was a dynasty for nearly two decades, went through a miserable two-year stretch in which it won four games each season, fired two coaches, drafted a quarterback and have now executed a staggering turnaround by going to the Super Bowl in Mike Vrabel's first season at the helm.

When other teams fire their coaches, this is what they hope will happen to them.

### 5) Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold
He simply played the game of his life in the 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, often with pressure in his face.

That it happened a year after a playoff meltdown ended his time with the Vikings — after the Jets, Panthers and 49ers had also given up on him — will undoubtedly be revisited in the two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl. That it happened against the team that picked him off four times earlier this season should have finally answered the question that has dogged Darnold his entire career: No, he will not mentally unravel, and yes, he can win the big game. Now he's on to the biggest one of his career.

### 6) Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III
The Seahawks back is on an expiring contract, and with teammate Zach Charbonnet out with a torn ACL, this was a showcase opportunity to display what a dual threat he is.

Walker delivered, running for the Seahawks' first touchdown and grinding out a tough 6-yard run to reach the two-minute warning with the Rams having no timeouts remaining. He finished with 19 carries for 62 yards and added four receptions for 49 yards.

### 7) Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba
One play he was turning around a defender on a post route, another he was lined up in the slot for a screen, and another he was slipping into the end zone with the defense somehow losing him.

Smith-Njigba was everywhere. The Rams had no answer for him, regardless of alignment. He finished with 10 receptions for 153 yards and a touchdown — six more catches than any other Seahawk — and sent a clear message to the Patriots: Lose JSN at your own peril.

### 8) Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford
Stafford was superb, throwing for 374 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. The season began with questions about how long he could play with a bad back, evolved into an MVP-level campaign, and now ends with questions about how many more years he has left.

## Losers

### 1) Going for it on fourth down
Sean Payton will be thinking about his decision early in the second quarter to bypass a chip-shot field goal — with a seven-point lead, a backup quarterback and clear conditions — to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Patriots' 14-yard line.

The pass fell incomplete. In what quickly became a low-scoring, weather-driven game, that choice loomed larger as conditions worsened. It will cast a long shadow over the memory of this season.

### 2) Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham
Stidham hadn't thrown a meaningful pass in two years, and he made several impressive throws Sunday. But two mistakes were costly.

The first was a backward pass under pressure deep in Denver territory that resulted in a Patriots fumble recovery and their only touchdown. The second came just before the two-minute warning, when Stidham lofted a pass into the wind that Christian Gonzalez intercepted. Stidham battled admirably in relief of Bo Nix, but it's fair to wonder how different this game might have looked if Nix had been healthy.

### 3) Patriots pass protection
The Patriots have two weeks to figure out how to better protect Maye, who has been sacked 15 times in three playoff games. He was sacked 47 times in the regular season.

New England has survived thanks to elite defense and improved ball security from Maye, but there’s no appetite for continuing to let their franchise quarterback absorb this much punishment.

### 4) Seahawks pass rush and tackling
The league’s top-ranked defense is heading to the Super Bowl, but it was sloppy Sunday. Seattle allowed 479 yards, sacked Stafford just once and recorded only three quarterback hits.

The Seahawks did come up with a crucial fourth-quarter stop, but New England’s mobile quarterback presents a different challenge. Getting Drake Maye on the ground will be essential.

### 5) Rams special teams
Special teams have plagued the Rams all season — to the point that Sean McVay fired his coordinator — and they may have cost them a Super Bowl berth.

Early in the third quarter, with Seattle up four, Xavier Smith muffed a punt recovered by Dareke Young. One play later, Sam Darnold threw a 17-yard touchdown pass, stretching the lead to 11. For a team that often looked like the NFL’s best, a persistent flaw proved fatal when it mattered most.
