We here at NFL.com have been doing a running ranking of the best games of the season, and it looked like we might going to go wire to wire with the best game — the opening weekend epic between the Bills and Ravens that featured the best of Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and the Bills rallying from a 15-point deficit in the closing minutes.

And then Week 16 happened. With the playoffs approaching and the stakes raised, there was complete mayhem. An overtime thriller between fierce rivals. Another overtime thriller between fierce rivals. The end of one of the oddest streaks in NFL history. And that was all before Sunday even started.

It's our job to sort through the fallout. Our heads are still spinning and we haven't even hit the eggnog yet, but here's our view of what it all meant, with two weeks to go.

## 1) The Bears have the clutch gene

There is plenty of time to dissect the lack of offensive consistency, and perhaps that will emerge as a stumbling block in the postseason. But the Bears have no shortage of nerve or role players who perform at the right moment. Saturday's victory over the Packers was the Bears' sixth fourth-quarter comeback win this season, fueled by an onside kick recovery by special teamer Josh Blackwell and a fourth-down touchdown reception by undrafted rookie Jahdae Walker.

Caleb Williams, for better or worse, is unafraid to throw the ball in big moments. Sometimes it results in an interception in the end zone, as it did two weeks ago when the Bears lost at Lambeau. And sometimes it results in a spectacular overtime 46-yard toss that dropped perfectly over a defender's shoulder into DJ Moore's arms. Because the Bears have won nail-biters all season, they believe they can win more of them and that confidence can go a long way. If the NFC standings hold up, the Bears would host the Packers in Wild Card Weekend. Yes, please.

## 2) The Packers might be OK in a post-Micah world

The Micah Parsons-less defense held the Bears to just nine points for 59 minutes and 36 seconds. After playing most of the game without their best player on offense (Jordan Love), their best player on defense (Parsons) and their second-best player on offense (Josh Jacobs), and going 0-for-5 in the red zone, it still took a truly bananas series of events to send the Packers to a loss.

The Packers still have a spot in the playoffs, and their first game without Parsons suggests his absence won't completely doom them.

## 3) Fretting about Sam Darnold in a big moment can subside

We'll get more evidence in the final weeks of the regular season and into the postseason, but Darnold came up big — and cool — in the Seahawks' dramatic comeback win on Thursday night. After throwing two interceptions earlier in the game, he led two touchdown drives, including the nine-play, 65-yard game-winner in overtime, and threw three successful two-point conversions. Darnold never looked rattled.

## 4) We now all know the intricacies of the backward pass rule

Much of the NFL universe got a badly needed lesson in rules minutiae when Sam Darnold's backward pass — which bounced off Jared Verse's helmet and wound up in the end zone — resulted in a successful two-point conversion recovered by Zach Charbonnet.

Even Sean McVay and Matthew Stafford were confused by the rule, which allows either team to recover a backward pass. The entire NFC playoff picture and home-field advantage may have been determined by it.

## 5) Offensive pass interference can end a game

On fourth down, the Steelers appeared to stop the Lions short of the goal line after Amon-Ra St. Brown was pushed back, only for him to lateral to Jared Goff, who ran it in for a touchdown. But St. Brown had been flagged for offensive pass interference, negating the score and ending the game.

The Steelers won to stay ahead of the Ravens in the AFC North. As a result of the Lions loss, the Bears and 49ers clinched playoff berths.

## 6) Pay attention to the Jaguars

The Jaguars delivered a statement win in Denver, snapping the Broncos' 11-game winning streak. Trevor Lawrence is playing the best football of his career, throwing three touchdowns, running for one and avoiding turnovers. Jacksonville holds a one-game lead in the AFC South and could still contend for the AFC's top seed.

---

## 7) Turnovers continue to haunt the Buccaneers

A late Baker Mayfield interception ended Tampa Bay’s bid to beat the Panthers. Since Week 7, the Bucs have committed 10 turnovers and gone 2-6. Despite getting healthier, the offense hasn’t found its rhythm, and Tampa Bay has lost three straight division games.

---

## 8) The Chargers may survive their offensive line injuries

The Chargers’ win over the Cowboys marked the first game this season in which they allowed no sacks. With an elite defense and Justin Herbert upright, Los Angeles has proven dangerous, boasting wins over the Broncos, Steelers and Eagles.

---

## 9) The tush push may fade away naturally

The Eagles’ once-automatic play has been far less effective in 2025. Their success rate has dropped dramatically since last season, and false starts have plagued the play. Despite the decline, Philadelphia clinched the NFC East, becoming the first repeat division champion in 20 years.

---

## 10) The Saints are worth watching again

The Saints have won three straight games and may have found their quarterback in rookie Tyler Shough. Against the Jets, he threw for 308 yards and a touchdown without an interception. With winnable games ahead, New Orleans has reason for optimism heading into 2026.
