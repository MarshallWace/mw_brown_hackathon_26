## EARLY GAMES

### Seattle Seahawks 27, Carolina Panthers 10

**Kevin Patra's takeaways:**

**Seahawks defense pounds Panthers for road win to stay atop NFC.**  
Mike Macdonald’s defense controlled the contest, pummeling the Panthers up front and smothering Carolina’s passing attack. Seattle turned the tide of a sloppy game in the second half, forcing back-to-back turnovers to set up short scores that blew the game open. The Seahawks held Carolina to 139 total yards, 1 of 11 on third downs and 10 first downs. Macdonald’s D bamboozled Bryce Young into panicked decisions and ineffective passes. The Panthers QB finished 14-of-24 passing for a paltry 54 yards with an interception — the fewest passing yards in a start in Young's career. Carolina didn’t have a play longer than 11 yards the entire game. Demarcus Lawrence was a menace, forcing and recovering a massive fumble and adding a sack to silence any comeback bid. The Seahawks remain the No. 1 seed heading into Week 18.

**Charbonnet powers Seahawks offense.**  
Zach Charbonnet was the best offensive player on the field, ripping through arm tackles and gobbling up yards when Seattle’s offense struggled. He totaled 110 rushing yards and two touchdowns, including runs of 29 and 25 yards — the only plays of 20-plus yards in the game. Sam Darnold turned the ball over twice and lacked consistency, a concern entering the postseason.

**Dismal Carolina loss sets up win-and-in Week 18 in NFC South.**  
The Panthers missed a chance to clinch the division, but still have a win-and-in opportunity against Tampa Bay in Week 18. Dave Canales’ team must clean up run defense and wake up offensively.

**Next Gen Stats Insight:** All of Bryce Young's production came on passes under 10 air yards (14 of 18 for 54 yards). On throws over 10 air yards, he went 0-for-3 with an interception.

### Cincinnati Bengals 37, Arizona Cardinals 14

**Michael Baca's takeaways:**

**Burrow & Co. showcase offense yet again.**  
Joe Burrow led a dominant offensive showing, converting 27 first downs and scoring on six of seven possessions. Burrow completed 77.4% of his passes for 305 yards and two touchdowns. Chase Brown amassed 141 scrimmage yards and two scores, while Ja'Marr Chase added two touchdowns. The Bengals displayed their full offensive potential in a lopsided win.

**Something's gotta give in Arizona.**  
The Cardinals struggled mightily, managing little early offense and allowing heavy pressure on Jacoby Brissett. Trey McBride set the single-season TE reception record, but much of his production came in garbage time. Arizona’s defense also lacked intensity, continuing a disappointing season.

**Bengals D building confidence.**  
Cincinnati’s defense dominated up front, recording four sacks and eight QB hits. Cedric Johnson, Shemar Stewart, Myles Murphy and T.J. Slaton all contributed to a strong showing.

**Next Gen Stats Insight:** Chase Brown forced nine missed tackles and recorded 68 yards after contact, both career highs.

### Cleveland Browns 13, Pittsburgh Steelers 6

**Nick Shook's takeaways:**

**Browns defense slams the door.**  
Jim Schwartz’s defense repeatedly thwarted Pittsburgh, making critical stops in the fourth quarter. Denzel Ward shut down late end-zone attempts, and Cleveland denied Aaron Rodgers at the goal line to seal the win.

**Metcalf's absence dooms Steelers.**  
Without DK Metcalf, Pittsburgh struggled to stretch the field and converted just 3 of 15 third downs. Rodgers posted one of his lowest passer ratings of the season.

**No record, but plenty of holiday joy in Cleveland.**  
Myles Garrett fell one sack short of the single-season record but drew constant attention, helping free teammates to make plays in another win over Pittsburgh.

### Jacksonville Jaguars 23, Indianapolis Colts 17

**Nick Shook's takeaways:**

**Jaguars play with food but finish the job.**  
Jacksonville made several mistakes but ultimately closed out its 12th win. Trevor Lawrence and the defense delivered when it mattered most, providing a valuable lesson heading into the playoffs.

**Rivers' comeback falls short again.**  
Philip Rivers’ lack of downfield arm strength limited Indianapolis’ offense, preventing the Colts from capitalizing on opportunities.

**Washington continues to thrive.**  
Parker Washington emerged again as Trevor Lawrence’s favorite target, catching eight passes for 115 yards and solidifying his role in the offense.

### Miami Dolphins 20, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 17

**Eric Edholm's takeaways:**

**Turnovers haunted Bucs in another disappointing loss.**  
Baker Mayfield threw two interceptions and lost a fumble, undermining Tampa Bay’s efforts despite late drama.

**Ewers did his job for the Dolphins.**  
Quinn Ewers delivered a steady performance, throwing two first-half touchdowns and avoiding turnovers as Miami leaned on its run game.

**Bucs’ defense, special teams came up short.**  
Missed tackles, coverage busts and special-teams miscues contributed to another loss, setting up a critical Week 18 showdown.

### New England Patriots 42, New York Jets 10

Drake Maye threw five touchdown passes as New England finished 8-0 on the road and clinched the AFC East.

**Jets defense hits new low.**  
New York allowed touchdowns on six straight possessions, continuing a brutal December slide.

**Chase Young changes the game.**  
Young’s strip-sack touchdown flipped momentum and powered the Saints’ defense.

**Raiders inch closer to No. 1 pick.**  
Despite aggressive play-calling, Las Vegas lost its 10th straight game and remains in prime position for the top draft pick.

**Giants win with meaning.**  
New York played inspired football under interim coach Mike Kafka, sacrificing draft position for a morale-boosting victory.

Jaxson Dart delivered an efficient performance, completing over 70% of his passes and rushing for two scores.

### Philadelphia Eagles 13, Buffalo Bills 12

**Nick Shook's takeaways:**

**Eagles remain a one-half team.**  
Philadelphia dominated early, then stalled offensively, relying on defense to survive a late Buffalo push.

**Allen’s foot injury looms large.**  
Josh Allen showed reduced mobility, limiting Buffalo’s offensive ceiling.

**Carter makes instant impact.**  
Jalen Carter returned from injury and made critical contributions, including a blocked extra point.
