Super Bowl LX is set and it's a matchup that should produce another great game in a postseason that has been flush with those. The Seattle Seahawks outlasted the Los Angeles Rams with a 31-27 victory in the NFC Championship Game. The New England Patriots survived the Denver Broncos and the elements in a 10-7 win in the AFC Championship Game. Both of those contests came down to the final minutes. This year's Super Bowl could involve its own level of late-game suspense, largely because of the similarities between these squads.

These two teams are coached by two of the best in the business (Mike Vrabel in New England and Mike Macdonald in Seattle). They each have quarterbacks trying to establish their own legacies (Drake Maye and Sam Darnold) and the defenses are no joke. If you like physical football, you are about to watch plenty of it. These teams are built to win by bullying their opponents down after down.

The first question to ask now that Championship Sunday has ended is obvious: Who's going to win this thing? That's where this edition of *The First Read* comes in. This game will be fun and it will come down to a variety of factors. These are the five that will make the biggest difference in the eventual outcome …

## 1) Will Sam Darnold save his best for last?

It's difficult to imagine Darnold doing more than he just did in his team's NFC Championship win over the Rams. The same guy who had been in game-manager mode for the second half of the regular season — he hadn't thrown for more than 300 yards since a Week 9 win over Washington — overwhelmed the Rams defense in his best performance of the 2025 campaign.

Darnold outdueled Matthew Stafford, finishing with 346 passing yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. More importantly, he ended all discussions about whether he can thrive in big-game situations. All the skeptics who smirked when he imploded in his final two games in Minnesota — including a blowout loss to these same Rams in the Wild Card Round — can now shut the hell up.

Darnold had his share of doubters when he signed with Seattle. They slowly vanished as he led the Seahawks to a 14-3 record, the NFC West title, the top seed in the NFC playoffs and a 41-6 Divisional Round win over the injury-riddled 49ers. This was the game Darnold needed to have, as the Seahawks won because he was on their side and there wasn't a soul-crushing mistake to be found anywhere.

Now Darnold leads the Seahawks into Super Bowl LX against a New England team that has been winning largely because of its defense. The Patriots abused Justin Herbert, C.J. Stroud and Denver's Jarrett Stidham on the way to winning the AFC Championship. There was once a time when Darnold would have faced questions about whether he was mentally tough enough for moments like this. He's already shown he can handle the pressure. The only thing left to prove is whether he can do it one more time.

## 2) Can Drake Maye return to regular-season form?

The Patriots aren't playing in their NFL-record 12th Super Bowl because Maye has dominated the postseason. They're here because he's developed a knack for making the right play when it matters most.

New England beat Denver with Maye completing 10 of 21 passes for 86 yards and no touchdowns. He's been sacked 15 times in the postseason and committed five turnovers. Yet those struggles haven't stopped him from delivering in the clutch. His 65 rushing yards against Denver included the game's only touchdown and a key 7-yard run that clinched the win in the final two minutes.

Maye also ran for 66 yards in a Wild Card win over the Chargers and finished the regular season with 450 rushing yards, fourth-most among quarterbacks. The issue is that New England isn't winning a seventh Super Bowl against a defense as stingy as Seattle's if Maye is limited to scrambling for survival.

Maye became an MVP finalist because he terrorized defenses with both his arm and legs. He led the league in passer rating (113.5) and completion percentage (72 percent), throwing for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Weather and elite defensive opponents have played a role in his postseason struggles, but the Patriots will need something closer to that version of Maye to beat Seattle.

## 3) Can the Patriots contain Jaxon Smith-Njigba?

New England's defense has dominated the postseason, but it hasn't faced a receiver like Jaxon Smith-Njigba. JSN led the league with 1,793 receiving yards and accounted for 46.2 percent of Seattle's passing offense.

He was dominant again in the NFC Championship Game, catching 10 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown. Seattle also benefits from having Cooper Kupp and Rashid Shaheed, who create space and matchup problems that make Smith-Njigba even more dangerous.

The Patriots counter with an elite secondary. Christian Gonzalez has emerged as one of the league’s best cornerbacks and sealed Sunday’s AFC Championship win with an interception. Carlton Davis has been steady on the other side, and Marcus Jones has been a game-changer as a returner and nickelback.

New England’s defense rattled C.J. Stroud and intercepted him four times in the Divisional Round. That group is good enough to disrupt most passing games. The challenge now is slowing down the league’s most productive receiver on the biggest stage.

## 4) Which head coach will be more prepared for the moment?

The Coach of the Year race is crowded, and both Vrabel and Macdonald have compelling cases. Vrabel took over a 4-13 Patriots team and immediately instilled a championship culture. The Patriots earned their place here by being disciplined, physical and prepared in all three phases.

Macdonald has accomplished much of the same in Seattle, pairing a suffocating defense with a high-scoring offense and watching his team grow stronger each week. The Seahawks have played every postseason game as if they already knew the answers to the test.

Neither team has a quarterback or roster filled with Super Bowl veterans. That’s why this game likely comes down to a wrinkle, a detail, or a play that’s been saved for the right moment. Both Vrabel and Macdonald excel in that area, which makes this chess match one of the most intriguing aspects of Super Bowl LX.

## 5) Who's going to be the X-factor?

Both teams have reached this point by relying on more than just their stars. For Seattle, Rashid Shaheed stands out as a constant big-play threat. He helped set up the Seahawks’ first touchdown against the Rams with a 51-yard catch and previously ignited a blowout of the 49ers with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.

Shaheed is also dangerous on jet sweeps and gadget plays, making him a problem wherever he lines up. The Patriots will be keenly aware of his speed.

New England has no shortage of candidates. Rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson rushed for 911 yards during the season and produced four runs of 50-plus yards. Kayshon Boutte leads the Patriots in postseason receiving yards. Marcus Jones has returned two punts and two interceptions for touchdowns this year.

It wouldn’t be surprising if any one of those players delivered a momentum-shifting play. Both teams reached the Super Bowl by leaning on depth and timely contributions. It makes perfect sense that Super Bowl LX could be decided the same way.
