Five NFL teams saw their dreams of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy end over the weekend. The Panthers, Packers, Jaguars, Chargers and defending Super Bowl champion Eagles all fell in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs, each in a game in which it seemed a play or two could have swung the outcome their way.

In a postseason that promised to be wide open, we had three games decided by late touchdowns, a fourth come down to a red zone stop and the fifth stay within one score for most of the night before one team (the Patriots) pulled away late.

Five organizations are moving on to the offseason, and we're here to help. I'll break down what went wrong for each franchise in the wild-card round, how it might have been foreseeable and what they can do to avoid the same fate next season.

## Los Angeles Chargers  
**Lost 16-3 vs. Patriots**

Justin Herbert endured one of the most punishing playoff performances of his career. With no run-game support, limited separation from receivers and an overwhelmed offensive line, Herbert took 21 hits in Foxborough — the most for any Jim Harbaugh–coached quarterback in a single game.

The Chargers’ offense struggled to diagnose New England’s coverages. Herbert went just 3-of-8 for 21 yards against pressure, and no receiver topped 32 yards. Injuries up front loomed large: losing both Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt turned a top-tier offense into a below-average unit.

The offseason focus is clear: rebuild the interior offensive line, stabilize the run game and decide whether offensive coordinator Greg Roman should return after two underwhelming seasons. With Slater and Alt returning in 2026, there’s optimism — but the margin is thinner than it appears.

## Philadelphia Eagles  
**Lost 23-19 vs. 49ers**

This loss felt like the defining version of a frustrating 2025 Eagles defeat. Early success gave way to a stagnant offense, penalties erased big plays, and depth players were exposed once injuries mounted.

Without Lane Johnson, the offensive line struggled again. Jalen Hurts couldn’t escape pressure late, and the passing game sputtered when it mattered most. Defensively, breakdowns in coverage allowed San Francisco to exploit mismatches, particularly against linebackers and safeties.

The Eagles’ faith in talent over adjustment finally cracked. Coaching questions will linger, especially around offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo, but a wholesale reset feels unlikely. Still, the offense needs evolution if this core is to contend again.

## Jacksonville Jaguars  
**Lost 27-24 vs. Bills**

The Jaguars let this game slip away by abandoning what worked best. Despite Buffalo ranking near the bottom of the league against the run, Jacksonville leaned too heavily on Trevor Lawrence, who struggled with consistency and threw two costly interceptions.

Bhayshul Tuten and Travis Etienne Jr. combined for 118 yards on just 14 carries. The efficiency was there — the commitment was not. Meanwhile, Josh Allen dissected a secondary that couldn’t hold up without consistent pass rush pressure.

Jacksonville’s roster overhaul produced mixed results. Jakobi Meyers and Parker Washington emerged, but the trade for Travis Hunter remains a question mark. This offseason will be about clarifying roles, especially at wide receiver and cornerback, and ensuring the offense maximizes its strengths.

## Green Bay Packers  
**Lost 31-27 vs. Bears**

A five-game collapse ended Green Bay’s season. After leading 21-3 at halftime, missed kicks, stalled offense and defensive confusion allowed Chicago to storm back.

Josh Jacobs wore down late, special teams faltered again, and the defense struggled to adjust post-snap. The absence of Micah Parsons loomed large, as pressure came late instead of fast.

Matt LaFleur’s game management drew scrutiny, but firing him would be reactionary. The Packers are young, talented and competitive — but they’re stuck in neutral. This offseason likely brings retooling, not rebuilding.

## Carolina Panthers  
**Lost 34-31 vs. Rams**

There are no moral victories in the playoffs, but Carolina showed meaningful growth. After falling behind early, the Panthers battled back and took a late lead before Matthew Stafford delivered the decisive drive.

Bryce Young was excellent under heavy pressure, displaying poise, creativity and anticipation. Rookie receiver Jalen Coker broke out, and the offense showed signs of sustainability — something that hadn’t been true earlier in the season.

The Panthers still need defensive reinforcements and offensive line stability, but for the first time in years, they enter the offseason with quarterback certainty. That alone makes this loss different from those that came before it.

Outside the league’s elite, many franchises would envy where these teams stand. The difference between January heartbreak and February glory is often thinner than it looks — and that’s what makes the NFL unforgiving.
